# Privacy Policy for Copy as Markdown for AI Chat

**Last updated:** 2026-02-24

## Overview

"Copy as Markdown for AI Chat" (hereinafter "the Extension") is a Chrome browser extension that converts selected AI chat content to Markdown format and copies it to the user's clipboard. The Extension operates entirely locally within the user's browser.

## Data Collection

This Extension does **not** collect any personal data or user information. Specifically:

- No personally identifiable information is collected
- No browsing history is collected or tracked
- No analytics or telemetry data is collected
- No cookies or local storage are used to store user data
- No user accounts or sign-ins are required
- No network requests are made by the Extension

## Data Usage

Since this Extension does not collect any user data, no user data is used for any purpose. The Extension's sole function is to convert selected HTML content on the current page to Markdown format and copy the result to the user's clipboard. This conversion happens entirely within the user's browser and no data leaves the user's device.

## Data Storage

This Extension does not store any user data. No data is saved to local storage, cookies, or any other persistent storage mechanism. The converted Markdown text is only placed in the user's system clipboard as part of the copy operation and is not retained by the Extension.

## Data Sharing

This Extension does not share any data with third parties. No data is transmitted to external servers, third-party services, or any other entities. The Extension makes no network requests of any kind.

## Permissions

This Extension requires the following browser permissions:

- **clipboardWrite**: Used solely to write the converted Markdown text to the user's clipboard when the user triggers the copy action via keyboard shortcut.

## Content Scripts

The Extension injects a content script on `chatgpt.com` to detect the user's text selection and convert it to Markdown format. This processing happens entirely within the user's browser. No page content is collected, stored, or transmitted.

## Third-Party Services

This Extension does not use any third-party services, APIs, SDKs, or libraries that collect user data.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
